# Can You Guess the Secret Kitten?
I foster kittens for the local animal shelter, and I wanted a way to catalog all the kittens in my life. Each kitten is unique, with its own "special" qualities. This game first determines if the user is a psychopath based on whether or not they like kittens. Non-psychopaths can then continue to the guessing game. A secret kitten is chosen at random, and hints are randomly given out after each incorrect guess. Once the user guesses correctly, they can see how well they did. After the game, the user can view the secret kitten and all the other kittens in my life. The game may be a bit challenging for people who don't know me personally, but everyone will enjoy seeing all the cute kitties.
